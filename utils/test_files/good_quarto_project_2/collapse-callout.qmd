## Callout Blocks

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::

:::{.callout-caution}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

:::{.callout-important}

This is important
:::


:::{.callout-warning icon='false' collapse='false'}

# WATCH OUT !!

This one is not collapsed by default because `collapse='false'` as been seen on 

```markdown
:::{.callout-warning icon='false' collapse='false'}
```
