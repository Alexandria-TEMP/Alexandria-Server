title: "Quarto Example: Relative Paths in Includes"
---

[Include shortcodes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) are powerful but can be unintuitive, especially when it
comes to paths.

This example shows the behavior of relative paths in includes, and how you can make use of them.

We illustrate the behavior with files in two different subdirectories:

- [directory 1](directory-1/index.qmd)
- [directory 2](directory-2/index.qmd)
